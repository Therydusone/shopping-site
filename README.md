This is my shopping site that I made during process of learning React and Redux.

Thanks to this course and by making shopping site I solidified my knowledge about React that I've got from CodersLab bootcamp but also I've learned few new technologies:

- Firebase (connecting site to firebase, managing authentication, managing items to sell on server instead on javascript file),
- Redux (reworking site to using redux and sagas),
- Node.js (very basic knowledge of Node.js needed to make payments work)
- Stripe (connecting stripe to my site to implement playments).

This shopping site is my personal "documentation" that serves me as reminder how things work.
