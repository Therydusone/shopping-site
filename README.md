## Shopping site with React

This is my very first React project that I made with help of React course to learn most of the basic and some advenced techniques React has to offer. Thanks to this course I was able to understeand principles behind React and I am ready to use them in my own projects.

#### Styling

For styling I went trough scss compiler that React has to offer to better solutions that are **Styled Components**

#### Database and authentication

Those two tasks are handled by Firebase authenticator - both Google and via e-mail and password.

For database I also used Firebase and integrated my app so every items and categories are stored as Documents and Collections

#### State 

Considering my application uses state in lots of places I used redux with jelp of redux-sagas to handle it.

#### Payments

For payments I connected my ap with Stripe API so I can make fake-payments with test cards to see how it works

#### Deployment

Site is deployed on herokuapp to see how it works and behaves in real life https://sklep-pszemka.herokuapp.com/

- [x] Connect project to Firebase
- [x] Connect project to StripeAPI
- [x] Implement Redux
- [ ] Security
- [ ] Test
